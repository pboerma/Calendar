# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

For this Assignemnet we are required to build out a simple Calendar that will be able to update according to the time of day, whether it has been in the past, present or future

# The functionality

The calendar has timeslots for each hour from 9am to 5pm
Each slot will allow for you to save your note to localStorage so if you refresht the page it will not clear
As real time progress, the colour of the timeslots will update accordingly


# Challenges

There were so many different examples on how to edit the time lapse and colour code so I struggled to implement the code at first however I ended up using a loop js to update the rules for the colour coded blocks
